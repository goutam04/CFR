Hi everyone,

I have successfully completed the statement optimization SIT testing, and the results look promising. With this change, we will generate statements based on accounts within GS, creating about 1,500 statements instead of 33,500.

Here are the breakdowns:

**Statement Generation:**
- Previously took about 60 hours; now will be done within 4 hours.

**Statement Upload:**
- Uploading statements from GS to GWA will take 2 hours.

**Validation and Activation:**
- Expected to take another 2 hours.

Overall, the process will take 8 to 10 hours, allowing us to complete it within a working day. We've agreed with Fightech to kickstart this every morning on the second working day, ensuring statements are posted by the end of the day. This schedule gives us an extra day if issues arise since clients expect statements by the third working day.

Thank you.
